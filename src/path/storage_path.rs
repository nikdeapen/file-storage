/// A file or folder path.
///
/// # Base & Extension
/// Storage paths are divided into a base and an extension. The base is effectively immutable and
/// the extension is a sequence of segments divided by file-separators.
///
/// Unix Example:
/// Path:           /the/path
/// Base:           /
/// Extension:      the/path
///
/// Windows Example:
/// Path:           C:\The\Path
/// Base:           C:\
/// Extension:      The\Path
///
/// URL Example:
/// Path:           https://example.com/the/path
/// Base:           https://example.com/
/// Extension:      the/path
///
/// # Files & Folders
/// A storage path can be a file path or a folder path. These are mutually exclusive and
/// exhaustive. A storage path is a folder path if it is equal to its base or ends with a
/// file-separator, otherwise it is a file path.
